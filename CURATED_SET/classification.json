Structure of H2A consists of a histone fold domain extended by a short αC-helix and has both N- and C-terminal tails. αC-helix and C-terminal tail form \"docking domain\" that locks the H2A-H2B dimer onto the surface of H3-H4 tetramer [luger_crystal_1997].

This is a loosely defined group that encompasses major H2A histone proteins that are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotes and are highly conserved even between distantly related species. Such proteins are often called replication dependent (RD), replication coupled (RC), clustered or \"bulk\" histones [marzluff_metabolism_2008,talbert_histone_2021]. They are likely similar to the original H2A histones of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [malik_phylogenomics_2003], although a similar H2A.X variant might have been also ancestral [talbert_histone_2021]. Expression of canonical histones during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. Canonical histone genes are often present as large mulrigene families clustered together in certain locations of the genome. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution -- in many species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Sometimes this diversification is very subtle and species-specific (e.g. cH2A isoforms in human), in other cases there may be a spectrum of canonical-like proteins (e.g. plant canonical H2As which show higher sequence diversity than cH2Bs of animals). Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case. Within the current hierarchical classification system, additional information about the cH2A class may be gained by looking at the description of its subclasses. ",

Histone genes encodig these proteins have several particular features. 1) These genes lack introns and are found in multiple similar copies clustered along the genome togerther with other core histone genes (H3, H4, H2B, and optionally H1). The exact organisation may vary from tandemly repeated quintets of H3, H4, H2A, H2B, H1 genes transcribed from the same strand to  non-tandem jumbled arrays of genes transcribed from divergent promoters [pontarotti_long-term_2009]. 2) These genes are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in a coordinated fashion (hence the name \"replication dendent\") and produce mRNAs that are not polyadenylated but rather end in a conserved stem-loop, which is further bound by the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP). mRNAs are rapidly degraded after the S-phase. 3) These genes are present in a specialized nuclear domain, the histone locus body (HLB), which concetrates factors for histone mRNA transcription and processing (in humans these include NPAT, U7 snRNP, FLASH) [marzluff_birth_2017].",

For a general description see cH2A_(Animals) class. Replication-dependent histones in humans are found in four loci: a large cluster on chromosome 6 (more than 60 genes), two clusters on chromosome 1 (10-12 genes and 4 genes) and a single H4 gene on chromosome 12 (with a neighbouring H2AJ gene). Humans have 18 H2A genes that code for replication-dependent H2A histones. The cluster on chromosome 6 encodes 13 H2A genes (H2AC1, H2AC4, H2AC6, H2AC7, H2AC8, H2AC11, H2AC12, H2AC13, H2AC14, H2AC15, H2AC16, H2AC17) and several pseudogenes. The first cluster on chromosome 1 encodes 4 genes (H2AC18, H2AC19, H2AC20, H2AC21), and the second cluster on chromosome 1 endodes one gene (H2AC25). 18 genes enconde 11 protein variants. H2A18, H2AC19, H2AC20, H2AC21 encode isoforms that have a methionine instead of leucine at position 51 conferring a mobility shift in triton-acid urea gel electrophoresis (historically, H2A.2 symbol was used to mark this difference) [franklin_non-allelic_1977]. H2AC1 gene (formely, called HIST1H2AA, TH2A) is the most divergent gene of the family, together with H2BC1 they share a common promoter and maifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis and oocytes) [huynh_two_2016].",

In humans, H2A.X produces both polyadenylated mRNAs and mRNAs ending on a stem-loop. It is probale that it is ancestral to clustered H2A histones [talbert_histone_2021]. 3) The H2AJ gene on chromosome 12 encoding H2A.J histone variant is sequence wise very similar to other canonical H2As in human.

The repertoires of short histone H2A variants vary extensively among eutherian mammals due to lineage-specific gains and losses. Short H2A variants include H2A.B, H2A.L, H2A.P, H2A.Q, their genes are usually located on X chromosome and are intronless. These four clades of eutherian mammal short H2A variants emerged from a single, well-supported monophyletic clade, confirming their common ancestry [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Due to shortened docking domain and changes within the acidic patch nucleosomes incorporating short H2As wrap less DNA (120-130 bp) and form loosely packed chromatin. There are few conserved residues in the histone fold domain of sH2As that distinguish them from each other, instead much of their specialization may stem from changes in the N- and C-terminal tails of these variatns [molaro_evolutionary_2018].

Genes: Common ancestor of eutherian mammals encoded two or three H2A.B genes. Genes are usually located on X chromosome in three conserved locations (except in mouse, where H2A.B genes are located at other locations on X chromosome with unclear kinship to the ancestral genes that relocated to autosomes and decayed [molaro_evolutionary_2018]). Human and mouse have three genes encoding H2A.Bs [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Evolution: H2A.B is a rapildy evolving variant which is closely related to H2A.L, H2A.P, H2A.Q. It was suggested that H2A.B have been the subject to diversifying selection in simian primates, although mucj of the increased divergence of short histone H2A variants may be better explained by relaxed purifying selection [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Knock-out: H2A.B knock-out mice are viable, subfertile and display changes in splicing events [anuar_gene_2019]. Sequence: Around 50% identity with the canonical H2A, has truncated docking domain, divergent histone fold domain, altered acidic patch, arginine rich N-terminus [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Localization: H2A.B is expressed during mammalian male germ cell development and in the brain [molaro_evolutionary_2018,jiang_short_2020]. Originally, H2A.B  was characterized by its exclusion from the inactive X chromosome if overexpressed in female somatic cells [chadwick_novel_2001]. However, experiments in mouse testis revealed that H2A.B is in fact present on the inactive X chromosome  [soboleva_unique_2011]. Short H2A variants localize to sites of open chromatin and potentiate DNA synthesis, transcription, and splicing [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. This histone variant can bind to RNA directly in vitro and in vivo, and associates with mRNA at intron—exon boundaries [soboleva_new_2017]. Structural effects: H2A.B containing nucleosomes wrap less DNA (~120-130 bp instead of ~150 bp) [sugiyama_distinct_2014,doyen_dissection_2006], form loosely packed chromatin. Interactions: RNA processing factors, proteins involved in the piRNA pathway [jiang_short_2020]  Deposition: It was suggested that H2A.B is incorporated into DNA sites that are transiently exposed, for instance, during DNA replication [jiang_short_2020]. H2A.B-H2A dimers in nucleosomes can spontaneously be replaced by H2A-H2B dimers [hirano_histone_2021]. Disease: H2A.B is upregulated in cancer as other short H2A variants [chew_short_2021]. Caveats: Due to rapid evolution H2A.B function in different species may vary. For example, human H2A.B is retained during spermiogenesis, while is mouse it disappears and H2A.L is retained instead [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Mouse H2A.B has additional negative residue in acidic patch, which is thought to increase its propensity to compact nucleosomal arrays relative to human H2A.B."},

Originally, H2A.B  was characterized by its exclusion from the inactive X chromosome if overexpressed in female somatic cells [chadwick_novel_2001]. However, experiments in mouse testis revealed that H2A.B is in fact present on the inactive X chromosome  [soboleva_unique_2011]. Short H2A variants localize to sites of open chromatin and potentiate DNA synthesis, transcription, and splicing [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. In mouse this histone variant was shown to bind to RNA directly in vitro and in vivo, and associate with mRNA at intron—exon boundaries [soboleva_new_2017]. Structural effects: H2A.B containing nucleosomes wrap less DNA (~120-130 bp instead of ~150 bp) [sugiyama_distinct_2014,doyen_dissection_2006], form loosely packed chromatin. Interactions: RNA processing factors, proteins involved in the piRNA pathway [jiang_short_2020]  Deposition: It was suggested that H2A.B is incorporated into DNA sites that are transiently exposed, for instance, during DNA replication [jiang_short_2020]. H2A.B-H2A dimers in nucleosomes can spontaneously be replaced by H2A-H2B dimers [hirano_histone_2021]. Disease: H2A.B is upregulated in cancer as other short H2A variants [chew_short_2021]. Caveats: Due to rapid evolution H2A.B function in different species may vary. For example, human H2A.B is retained during spermiogenesis, while is mouse it disappears and H2A.L is retained instead [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Mouse H2A.B has additional negative residue in acidic patch, which is thought to increase its propensity to compact nucleosomal arrays relative to human H2A.B."},

        "description": {"summary":"H2A.L - is a class of short H2A variants in eutherian mammals implicated in spermatogenesis and replacement of histones with protamines. Genes: Сommon ancestor of eutherian mammals encoded three H2A.L genes. These genes are usually located on X chromosome at three locations (named H2A.L.1, H2A.L.2 and H2A.L.3 by Molaro et al.) [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Humans have two putative genes (H2AL1Q, H2AL3, located at H2A.L.1 and H2A.L.3 loci, respectively) and H2AL1MP pseudogene (located at H2A.L.2 loci has inactivating mutation in all primates). The H2AL1Q and H2AL3 genes have unusually long extensions at their 3'-ends and have not so far been detected at protein level. Mouse genome has a leneage specific expansion of H2A.L genes, encoding a total of 18 genes (15 genes on X chromosome H2a1a-H2a1o and H2al3; two genes on Y-chromosome H2al2c and H2al2b; one gene on chromosome 2 H2al2a) and two pseudogenes [molaro_evolutionary_2018].  At H2A.L.1 locus mouse has a pseudogene H2al1q-ps. The most studied gene in mice is H2al2a. This gene was first identified in [govin_pericentric_2007] (NCBI protein id NP_080903) and was refered to as H2AL2 or H2A.L.2 histone in the following papers. However, this gene is not located at the H2A.L.2 locus (as defined by Molaro et al.) on X-chromosome, but it is rather located on chromosome 2. A synthenic location of H2A.L.2 locus in mouse is occupied by H2al1m gene [Seal et al. unpublished]. Previous names for mouse H2A.Ls include H2A.Lap2, H2A.Lap3, H2A.Lap4, H2AL1, H2AL2 [soboleva_unique_2011, govin_pericentric_2007]. H2AL1 has been used to reffer to H2al1a gene [govin_pericentric_2007]. Evolution: Molaro et al. found that short H2A variants show greater evolutionary divergence between species than even CENPA, the fastest-evolving histone variant examined to date [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Evolutionary analysis of purifying selection suggested that H2A.L function may have been lost in Old World monkeys and hominoids but retained in New World monkeys [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Knock-out: H2A.L.2 knock out mice are infertile because transition proteins can no longer associate with chromatin [barral_histone_2017]. Function: Required for the histone–protamine exchange process [barral_histone_2017]. Sequence: Sequence is divergent from cH2A. Identity with cH2A may be as low as 30%. H2A.L variants have a shortened C-termus, truncated docking domain, altered acidic patch, arginine rich N-terminus. Nucleosomes incorporating H2A.L warp less DNA and from more loosely packed chromatin [molaro_evolutionary_2018].  Localization: Accumulates in spermatid nuclei until the end of spermatogenesis and remains in mature sperm chromatin even after protamine exchange in mouse, eventually disappearing from the paternal pronucleus following fertilization [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Involved in pericentric chromatin organization in spermatids, is retained after histone-to-protamine replacement [hoghoughi_rna-guided_2020]. H2A.L.2 is maximally expressed at later stages of spermatogenesis (condensing spermatids) when histones are bound by transition proteins and then replaced with protamines Structural effects: Interactions: H2A.L.2 preferentially dimerizes with H2B.1 (TH2B) at least in mice [govin_pericentric_2007]. Intranuclear localization of H2A.L.2 is controlled by its ability to bind RNA via its N-terminus [hoghoughi_rna-guided_2020]. Deposition: Likely mediated by interaction with RNA [hoghoughi_rna-guided_2020]. Disease: no information, since no H2A.L have been so far detect at protein level in humans. Caveats: there is some confusion in literature with respect to numbering H2A.L subvariants, especially in mouse (see caveats in description of mouse H2A.L variants)."},

See H2A.L description for more information. Caveats: there is some confusion with the variant names in the literature. Govin et al. initially identified and named three variants H2AL1, H2AL2, H2AL3 [govin_pericentric_2007]. These are encoded by H2al1a, H2al2a and H2ap genes, respectively. The H2Al2 endoded variant was later renamed in the literature as H2A.L.2 [jiang_short_2020]. The H2ap gencoded variant is in fact H2A.P in the current nomenclature. Alternatively, Molaro et al. have named three evolutionary conserved loci on X chromosome that harbor H2A.L genes, these loci are H2A.L.1, H2A.L.2 and H2A.L.3 [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. While human gene and variant naming is in line with the names of these loci, in mouse names of these loci do not correspond exactly to the originally proposed gene names except for H2A.L.3 locus which harbors H2al3 gene (not H2ap gene(!)). In mouse at H2A.L.1 locus a pseudogene H2al1q-ps is located, at H2A.L.2 locus mouse has H2al1m gene (H2al1a-H2al1o genes located within 5 megabases from this locus have similar protein sequences(?)), while H2A.L.2 variant encoded by H2al2a is located on chromosome 2 (two similar genes H2al2b and H2al2c are located on Y chromosome). In this classification we follow the numbering used in gene names which also corresponds to the one established earlier in the literature. Hence, H2A.L.2 variant in mouse encompasses H2al2a gene and similar H2al2b and H2al2c genes, while H2A.L.1 variant encompasses 14 H2al1a-H2al1o genes including H2al1m gene located at a syntenic location of the H2A.L.2 locus"},

Its expression in mouse has been shown only at mRNA level [el_kennani_ms_histonedb_2017], although evolutionary analysis strongly argues that it is a protein coding gene [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. In human H2A.P gene H2ap was previously named HYPM (Huntingtin-interacting protein M) since in yeast two-hybrid experiments it was shown to interact with huntingtin, which contains an expanded polyglutamine tract in individuals with Huntington's disease [faber_huntingtin_1998]. Genes: Сommon ancestor of eutherian mammals encoded a single H2A.P gene. These genes are usually located on X chromosome as do other short H2As [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Humans and mouse have one gene name H2AP and H2ap, respectively. Evolution: Molaro et al. found that short H2A variants show greater evolutionary divergence between species than even CENPA, the fastest-evolving histone variant examined to date. Their results indicate that H2A.P and possible H2A.B have been subject to diversifying selection in simian primates, which could partly ecplame the greater divergence of short H2A histone variants compared to other H2A histones in mammals [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. Knock-out: no studies. Function: no specific studies have been reported, but by its similarity to H2A.L it is likely that it participates in the histone–protamine exchange process. Sequence: Has one of the most divergent sequences from cH2A. Identity with cH2A may be as low as 24%. H2A.P variants have a shortened C-termus, truncated docking domain, altered acidic patch, arginine rich N-terminus. H2A.P have lost two key conserved arginine (R) residues in Loop 1 and 2 that contact the DNA minor-groove and acquired many acidic residues at sites including contacts with DNA and H2B. The last 14 residues in H2A.P are more evolutionary contrained than the rest of the protein, suggesting their potential interaction with non-histone proteins.

Like other intact short H2A genes, dog and pig H2A.Q genes are transcribed in testes but are undetectable in other tissues examined, including ovary [molaro_evolutionary_2018]. While tails of H2A.B and H2A.L are similar, they differ significantly from H2A.P and H2A.Q , suggesting that short histone H2A variants do not share the same function given the importance of the N-terminal tails in regulating nucleosome function [jiang_short_2020]. H2A.Q histone variants have variable N-terminus, truncated histone fold domain of variable length and altered acidic patch [molaro_evolutionary_2018]."},

It was characterized in human and mouse, similar genes are present in other mammals. It has been implicated in cell senesecence. Genes: In human it is encoded by H2AJ gene on chormomosome 12, in mouse by H2aj gene on chromosome 6. Both genes are intronless. H2aj gene lacks a stem-loop structure at the 3'-UTR but contains a poly (A) signal [nishida_novel_2005]. Similar genes are found in other mammals [contrepois_histone_2017]. Evolution: no studies available. Knock-out: Depletion of H2A.J via RNA interference modifies senesecence-associated chromatin re-structuring and abolishes senesecence-associated secretory phenotype in human fibroblasts subject to ionizing radiation [isermann_histone_2020]. Function, disease: It has been shown that H2A.J accumulates in senescent cells and promotes inflammatory gene expression [isermann_histone_2020,contrepois_histone_2017]. Sequence: It differs from canonical H2A protein sequences only by an A11V substitution and the presence of an SQK motif near the C-terminus, which is a potential phosphorylation site [talbert_histone_2021]. Localization: In fibroblast irradiation experiments it was shown that H2A.J colocalizes with 53BP1 and is incorporated at the periphery of so-called senesecence-associated chromatin foci (SAHF) [isermann_histone_2020]. Deposition: unclear. Structural effects: sequence changes lie only within the histone tails, alterations to the C-terminal tail may theoretically alter interactions with linker DNA and H1-histone, but this has not been studied.

Expression of cH2Bs during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. These histones are often present as large multigene families. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution -- in many species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Sometimes this diversification is very subtle and species-specific (e.g. cH2B.E isoforms in mouse), in other cases there may be a spectrum of canonical-like proteins (e.g. plant canonical H2Bs which show higher sequence diversity than cH2Bs of animals). Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case.

One additional gene H2BC12L is represented by a human-specific duplication of the H2BC12 gene from the chromosome 6 onto chromosome 21, the gene appears to be expressed, its protein sequence is expected to have two nonsynonymous substitutions with respect to H2BC12 gene. 19 cH2B genes in human enconde 15 protein variants. H2BC1 gene (formely, called HIST1H2BA, TH2B) is the most divergent gene of the family, together with H2AC1 they share a common promoter and maifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis and oocytes) [huynh_two_2016].",

This is the most divergent gene of the family (around 85% identity with other cH2Bs) [zalensky_human_2002]. Its length is also one amino acid longer than for the rest of H2Bs (126 amio acid residues after initiator methionine cleavage). Together with H2AC1 they share a common promoter and manifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis and oocytes) (see human protein atlas).  H2AC1 and H2BC1 are thought to be maternal effect factors and their expression was shown to enhance OSKM-induced cell reprogramming in human cells [huynh_two_2016]. See also description of cH2B.1_(Mus_musculus) -- a related histone variant encoded by H2bc1 gene which has been characterized through a number of in vivo and in vitro studies. Phylogenetic analysis of cH2B.1 in mammals by Raman et al. suggests that when considered together with its N-terminal tail histones form a distinct phylogenetic clade with high bootstrap support [raman_novel_2022].",

This is the most divergent gene of the family, its protein product has differences in INSERT HERE. Together with H2ac1 gene they share a common promoter and manifest tissue-specific expression (at least in testis, oocytes and zygotes) [padavattan_structural_2015]. Disruption of Th2a and Th2b genes causes defects in spermatogenesis [shinagawa_disruption_2015]. H2ac1 and H2bc1 contribute to activation of the paternal genome after fertilization [shinagawa_histone_2014]. These variant facilitate OSKM-induced cell reprogramming [shinagawa_histone_2014].  X-ray structure of nucleosome harboring this variant have fewer histone-DNA contacts and perturbed L1-L1-loop interactions. Mutational in vivo analysis suggest histone tails and L1 loop of cH2A.1 are important for reprogramming [padavattan_structural_2015]. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated that the H2ac1/H2bc1 complex was more stable than other combinations of canonical histones [shinagawa_histone_2014]. This variant is related to cH2B.1_(Homo_sapiens) encoded by H2B1C gene, is located in the same position at the largest histone gene cluster, however, their sequence differs at INSERT HERE positions. Structural and in vitro studies suggest that cH2B.1-containing nucleosomes are less stable than RC H2B, which may allow H2B.1 to facilitate histone-protamine exchange during spermatogenesis. More recently, H2B.1 has also been detected in mouse oocytes, where its function is not yet understood [raman_novel_2022]. Note: Since this variant manifests similar features in mice and humans (tissue-specific expression, synteny, divergent sequence with respect to other canonical variants in each species) likely similar variants exist in all supraprimates or in higher taxa. Once and if sufficient evidence accumulates such variants may be grouped into a separate class.",

Currently, this is a loosely defined group of replication-dependent H2B histones in plants together with similar sequences that might have further diversified towards replication-independent tissue-specific expression but have not yet been extensively studied. An example of the latter would be the HTB3 gene of Arabidopsis which has the hallmarks of a replacement histone variant enriched in mature cells [jiang_evolution_2020]. Organisation of canonical histones in green plants is variable. In land plants unlike clustered/canonical histones of animals (see cH2B_(Metazoa)) replication dependent histone mRNAs are polyadenilated and genes are interspersed throught the genome. In chlorophyte green algae, such as Chlamydomonas, genes are grouped in clusteres and mRNAs end in 3'-stem loop similar to those of histone genes in animals [marzluff_metabolism_2008, alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. Plant H2Bs vary substantially in the length and sequence of their N-terminal tails [jiang_evolution_2020,bergmuller_characterization_2007]. A study of evolution and functional divergence of H2B histones in plants by Jiang et al. concluded that amongst flowering plants, eudicots had experienced the highest degree of divergence among H2B genes [jiang_evolution_2020]. This divergence appears to have been driven by preferential expression during gametogenesis, including three genes in Arabidopsis (HTB7/8/10 genes) and at least one in tomato. While HTB8 gene in Arabidopsis belongs to a phylogenetically distinct H2B.S variant [jiang_evolution_2020], HTB7 and HTB10 are much more similar in sequence to other H2Bs for now are included as cH2B in our classification [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019].",

            {"summary":"CS_H2B_(Echinoidea) is a histone variant class containing cleavage-stage (CS) H2B histones characterized so far in sea urchins. Four classes of histones in sea urchins have been characterized. Three sets of histone variants are coexisting in the embryo at larval stages of sea urchin’s development: the maternally inherited cleavage stage variants (CS) expressed during the two initial cleavage divisions, the early histone variants, which are recruited into embryonic chromatin from middle cleavage stages until hatching and the late variants, that are fundamentally expressed from blastula stage onward [oliver_conservative_2003]. The fourth class of histones in sea urchins are the sperm histones. They are exclusively transcribed during spermatogenesis and code for specialized H1 and H2B proteins with basic N-terminal extensions which are responsible for the unusually high chromatin condensation in mature sperm [mandl_five_1997]. Early, late, and sperm histone genes lack introns, contain the conserved 3-prime terminal stem-loop structure instead of a poly(A) addition site, and thus show the classical hallmarks of replication-dependent histone genes. The CS proteins are the first histones to be synthesized after fertilization in the cleaving embryo. The CS histones appear to be synthesized during oogenesis and in the mature egg, where they give rise to a large maternal pool of histone proteins. The CS proteins are the only histones present in the chromatin of the egg and zygote up to the second cell division. Thereafter, the efficient synthesis of the early histones leads to a rapid dilution of the CS histones in the chromatin except in the nondividing small micromeres, where the CS proteins remain the major histones up to the pluteus larva stage. The maternally stored CS histones play an important role in remodeling of the sperm chromatin after fertilization. Upon entry in the egg cytoplasm, the sperm H1 and H2B proteins present in the male pronucleus are rapidly phosphorylated on their N-terminal extensions, and the sperm H1 protein is subsequently replaced in the chromatin by the CS H1 protein. This exchange of H1 histones is immediately followed by decondensation of the chromatin. At around the time of DNA replication, the CS H2A and H2B proteins start to accumulate in the chromatin of the male pronucleus, which correlates with the transition of the nucleosomal repeat length from 250 bp in the sperm chromatin to 200 bp in the early embryo. As a consequence of this massive chromatin restructuring, the paternal genome is transcriptionally activated already at the beginning of S phase in the first cell cycle, which further emphasizes the importance of the CS histones for early development [mandl_five_1997].",

Structurally H3 has a histone fold domain, αN-helix and a long N-terminal tail with many important post-translational modification sites.

The fact that eukaryotic cells undergo mitosis, in which chromosomes are highly compacted, together with the abundance of gene-poor regions may have favored a histone conformation that wraps DNA twice (eukaryotic octamer) instead of once (archaeal tetramer) and that via its N-terminal tails has the ability to compact DNA at ahigher order [henneman_structure_2018].",

This is a loosely defined group that encompasses major H3 histone proteins that are mainly expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle in eukaryotes and are highly conserved even between distantly related species. Such proteins are often called replication dependent (RD), replication coupled (RC), clustered or \"bulk\" histones [marzluff_metabolism_2008,talbert_histone_2021]. They are likely similar to the original H3 histones of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Expression of canonical histones during S-phase is often tightly regulated, but mechanisms may differ among kindoms [marzluff_birth_2017,pontarotti_long-term_2009]. Canonical histone genes are often present as large mulrigene families clustered together in certain locations of the genome. However, there are known limitations to the definition given above. Functional diversification of paralogous genes is a common process in evolution -- in some species multiple copies of canonical histone genes have undergone diversification in terms of sequence variation, cell-cycle or tissue-specific expression patterns. Such diversification for cH3s is rather limited compared to cH2As and cH2Bs. In humans there are only two very similar cH3 isoforms both expressed in S-phase (cH3.1 and cH3.2). However, the mamal-specific H3.4 variant, which manifests tissue specific expression, is in fact a very closely related to the canonical H3s (similarly to cH2A.1 and cH2B.1 is is located within histone gene clusters and has mRNA with a stem-loop). In plants, some cH3s show variable expression patterns [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. Hence, whether a particular gene should be regarded as a canonical, a bona fide variant or a canonical subvariant/isoform may be a matter of debate and definition in each particular case. Another complication with defining cH3 class is that major H3 variants, such as H3.3, may only have 3-4 amino acid deference with the canonical H3 histone. They may have arisen multiple times during evolution and hence their functional classification does not match the phylogenetic classificstion. Ascomycetes are thought to have lost cH3 genes and generally have only a single form which is H3.3-like, it is usually referred to simply as H3 [talbert_unified_2012, malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Within the current hierarchical classification system, additional information about the cH3 class may be gained by looking at the description of its subclasses. ",

This is a loosely defined group of replication-dependent H3 histones in plants together with similar sequences that might have further diversified towards replication-independent tissue-specific expression but have not yet been extensively studied. Currenly not much is known about the functional specialization of various cH3s isoforms in plants [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. The canonical histone H3 or cH3.1 from higher plants is remarkably similar to that of animals, fungi, and even lower eukaryotes. A sequence comparison indicates that only four amino acid substitutions, F41Y, K53R, A90M, and A96C, differentiate the canonical histone H3 from plants and mammals. Interestingly, the five HTR genes from Arabidopsis encoding histone H3.1 do not contain introns and are expressed in tissues containing highly dividing cells and all but one are expressed during the S-phase of the cell cycle. In a similar way, the seven genes encoding H3.1 from rice also lack introns and several of them are expressed in highly dividing tissues [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019].

It seems that a distinction between H3 and H3.3 types has arisen numerous times in evolution. Four such instances are at least evident in ciliates, apicomplexans, animals and plants [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. H3.3 are characterized by changes at four positions with respect to cH3s, one in the N-terminal tail and three in the alpha-2-helix of the histone fold domain. Strictly speaking, this is not convergent evolution because the H3.3 versions do not all have the same amino acid residues in these four positions. However, it strongly suggests that a similar constraint has led to these repeated origins of distinguishable H3 and H3.3 types [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. Although, given the likelihood of independent divergences, H3.3 variants from different taxonomic clades may be neither more nor less orthologous to animal H3.3 than their cH3 ounterparts [talbert_unified_2012]. Replication-independent and replication-coupled H3 variants within an organism typically differ in residue 31 (and whether it can be phosphorylated) as well as residues 86?? and 89, but distinguishing residues vary in different organisms and caution is advised in designating H3.3 in less wellstudied eukaryotic kingdoms [talbert_unified_2012].",

The rapid expansion of eukaryotic genomes, large portions of which became silent in differentiated cells, may have selected for H3 and its expansion, both for increasing bulk packaging duties and to ensure transcriptional silencing where appropriate. In this regard, it is important to note that even in the archaeon M. fervidus, this division of labor is evident between HMfA and HMfB5 [malik_phylogenomics_2003].",

The sequence differences within the alpha-2-helix alow H3.3 to interact specifically with its own chaperones (HIRA, ATRX, DAXX). At position 31 H3.3s instead of alanine have serine or threonine which can be phosphorilated. There are multiple studies showing that phosphorylation of this site is functionally important [talbert_unified_2012]. Particularly, H3.3S31ph is associated with H3.3K27 acetylation which helps gene activation and was shown to be essential for gastrulation in Xenopus [sitbon_histone_2020]. The metazoan histone H3.3 has been most closely associated with active transcription, replacing cH3s at active genes and promoters, implicated in diverse biological processes, including development, transcriptional memory and transcriptional reprogramming. However, genetic studies highlighted also its imortance in maintaining heterochromatin at telomeres, centromeres, and pericentromeric regions [jang_histone_2015], as well as revealed essential functions of H3.3 in the germline and early embryonic development [elsaesser_new_2010,yuen_histone_2014,jang_histone_2015].",

At the cellular level, H3.3 loss triggers cell cycle suppression and cell death. Surprisingly, H3.3 depletion does not dramatically disrupt gene regulation in the developing embryo. Instead, H3.3 depletion causes dysfunction of heterochromatin structures at telomeres, centromeres, and pericentromeric regions of chromosomes, leading to mitotic defects [jang_histone_2015]. In C. elegans Despite these specific expression patterns, we find that neither loss of individual H3.3 homologs nor the knockout of all five H3.3-coding genes causes sterility or lethality. However, we demonstrate an essential role for the conserved histone chaperone HIRA in the nucleosomal loading of all H3.3 variants. This requirement can be bypassed by mutation of the H3.3-specific residues to those found in H3. While even removal of all H3.3 homologs does not result in lethality, it leads to reduced fertility and viability in response to high-temperature stress [delaney_differential_2018]. Flies that lack both H3.3 genes have reduced viability and individuals that survive to adulthood are completely sterile in both sexes [sakai_transcriptional_2009]. Targeted disruption of one gene (H3f3b) results in a number of phenotypic abnormalities, including a reduction in H3.3 histone levels, leading to male infertility, as well as abnormal sperm and testes morphology. Additionally, null germ cell populations at specific stages in spermatogenesis, in particular spermatocytes and spermatogonia, exhibited increased rates of apoptosis. Disruption of H3f3b also altered histone post-translational modifications and gene expression in the testes, with the most prominent changes occurring at genes involved in spermatogenesis. Finally, H3f3b null testes also exhibited abnormal germ cell chromatin reorganization and reduced protamine incorporation [yuen_histone_2014].",

Its role in histone replacement at active genes and promoters is highly conserved and has been proposed to participate in the epigenetic transmission of active chromatin states [szenker_double_2011].

While the majority of nucleosomes are replaced by protamines during mammalian spermatogenesis, some H3.3 nucleosomes are retained and may transmit epigenetic information to the zygote [delaney_differential_2018]. In embryonic stem cells for example, HIRA chaperones H3.3 to both active and repressed genes, including also bivalent promoters normally repressed in embryonic stem cells. This highlights a role of HIRA in establishing chromatin landscapes not always related to active chromatin but key to allow proper differentiation [otero_histone_2014].",

Recurrent H3.3 histone mutations are increasingly identified in several malignancies and developmental disorders in human [kumar_genes_2021]. Well characterized oncomutations in H3.3 genes include K27M, G34W/L in pediatric high-grade gliomas and K36M and G34V/R in bone tumors [xiong_histone_2016]. Competing models have suggested that H3K27M oncohistones sequester or poison  PRC2 complex which deposits H3K27me3 marks. However, Sarthy et al. demonstrated that the K27M epitope only inhibits H3K27 trimethylation on chromatin in vivo, supporting the idea that these oncohistones inhibit chromatin-bound PRC2 complexes. A possible mechanism comes from recent reports [lee_automethylation_2019,wang_regulation_2019] showing that EZH2 (key component of PRC2) methylates  itself, and that this automethylation is required for full catalytic activity. These studies also showed that H3K27M blocks EZH2 automethylation, and might contribute to the dominant effect of H3K27M mutations [sarthy_histone_2020].",

However, this strongly suggests that a similar constraint has led to these repeated origins of distinguishable H3 and H3.3 types [malik_phylogenomics_2003].

H3.3 is likely involved in transcriptional regulation, is enriched in the body of actively transcribed genes, promoters and downstream of transcription termination sites in some genes [alvarez-venegas_canonical_2019]. Certain mechanisms of H3.3 action have been reported. Jacob et al. have shown that SET domain of the histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methyltransferase ATXR5 have a bipartite catalytic domain that specifically reads alanine-31 of H3.1. Thus variation at position 31 between H3.1 and replication-independent H3.3 is responsible for inhibiting the activity of ATXR5 and its paralog, ATXR6 [jacob_selective_2014]. Wollmann et al. proposed that H3.3 prevents recruitment of H1, inhibiting H1’s promotion of chromatin folding that restricts access to DNA methyltransferases responsible for gene body methylation. Thus, gene body methylation is likely shaped by H3.3 dynamics in conjunction with transcriptional activity [wollmann_histone_2017].",

It is, however, the main form of histone H3 in Ascomycetes, where canonical H3 was lost during evolution [malik_phylogenomics_2003]. While H3.3 in Ascomycetes is the only form of H3 histone it is mainly reffered to as H3 rather than H3.3. In the current classification we will refer to such histones as H3.3_(Ascomycota) to retain its proper placement within our classification. Basidiomycetes have both canonical H3 and H3.3 histones. Fungi H3.3 along with plant and animal H3.3s have evolved independently, but share similar sequence difference with respective canonical H3s. It is likely that they have evolved under similar contraints. Since H3.3 as a separate variant is available only in Basidiomycetes the H3.3/cH3 functional difference in Fungi remains poorly studied. Anju et al. have charaterized two H3 genes in basidiomycete Ustilago maydis U1 and U2. The U1 gene was shown to posses replication-independent expression and sequence characteristic of H3.3 replacement histones, while U2 gene manifested replication-coupled expression typical for canonical H3 [anju_identification_2011].",

This variant is also reffered to as H3.1t, H3T, or TS H3.4. The H3.4 variant is very similar to canonical H3 histones both in sequence, gene location and transcriptional regulation. In human H3.4 has only 4 amino acid difference from cH3s (A23V,V71M, A98S, A111V), its gene is located within histone gene cluster, is intronless, its mRNA has a stem-loop structure. H3.4 expression is  replication-dependent [ueda_testis-specific_2017]. Mouse H3.4 was shown to be essential for very early stages of spermatogenesis, its deficiency leads to azoospermia because of the loss of haploid germ cells. When differentiating spermatogonia emerge in normal spermatogenesis, H3.4 appears and replaces the canonical H3 proteins [ueda_testis-specific_2017]. Structural studies have revealed that H3.4 containing nucleosome are less stable, particularly due to V71M and A111V substitutions [tachiwana_structural_2010]. Tachiwana et al. have found that H3.4/H4 is not efficiently incorporated into the nucleosome by human Nap1 chaperone, due to its defective H3.4/H4 deposition on DNA. In contrast, human Nap2 chaperone, a paralog of Nap1, promoted nucleosome assembly with H3.4/H4. Mutational analyses revealed that the A111V mutation in H3.4 is essential for this difference [tachiwana_nucleosome_2008]. It was demostrated that A23V mutation favors the interaction of trymethyllysine-binding Tudor domains of PHF1 and PHF2 proteins (critical components of the PCR2 complex) with H3K27me3 marks. PHF1 co-localizes with H3.4 in testis and its Tudor domain preferentially binds to H3.4K27me3 over canonical H3K27me3 in vitro, implicating that H3.4K27me3 might be a physiological ligand of PHF1/19.
